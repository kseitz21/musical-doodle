    <h3>Discover</h3>
    <p>Starting our initial assessment of the website, a couple big things stood out right away: information overload
      and readability issues. During testing, users were struggling to find the information needed to purchase tickets
      since it was spread out all across the website. Even though the information was on the site, the overall design of
      the website was preventing users from getting the information they needed.</p>

    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="define" id="define">
    <h3>Define</h3>
    <p>As we started our brainstorming process, we knew that our best plan of attack was to start the website design
      from scratch. While we came up with a lot of feasible ideas, we wanted to make sure each area of concern was
      addressed while also balancing our capabilities within the short timeframe. Our feature prioritization matrix seen
      below helped us make sure to focus our energy on the features that would be the highest impact in the lowest time
      period first, then expand from there as time allowed.</p>

      <img src="./assets/Feature Prioritization.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Feature Prioritization Matrix</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>We also broke up our feature list into categories and put them in order of highest priority within the category.
      That gave us a clear guideline of the things we wanted to accomplish as a group and allowed for easy reference
      back to during the design process. </p>
    <ul class="component-list">
      <li>Visual Components
        <ul>
          <li>Color Scheme for accessibility and visibility</li>
          <li>Organization of home screen hierarchy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Navigation Components
        <ul>
          <li>Reorganize submenu options/add additional as needed</li>
          <li>Connecting concert information to payment information for smoother use</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Content Components
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce information overload on home page (esp. side columns)</li>
          <li>Organize information together that needs to be together</li>
          <li>Making sure sponsoring organizations are clearly visible</li>
          <li>Adding audio/video clips to support content as needed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="develop" id="develop">
    <h3>Develop</h3>
    <p>With feature priority in mind, we turned our focus into redesigning the layout of the home page. We wanted to
      find a happy medium between creating a design that was familiar to older uses, but also fresh to bring in new
      users. We went back and forth between a couple different designs-a trendy bento box style or a more basic but
      classic layout. </p>
    <div class="compare-photos">
      <figure class="figure" id="bento-box">
        <img src="./assets/bento-box-wireframe.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Bento Box Version</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="figure" id="classic">
        <img src="./assets/classic-wireframe.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Classic Layout</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>We were torn between the two designs since they served different purposes that would both technically solve some
      of our problems, so we ultimately looked back at our research and decided that we should go with the bento box, as
      it allowed us to still present a high amount of content all while keeping it condensed and clean, plus it kept all
      the information in a smaller distance with minimal scrolling. We iterated on that design with a few adjustments
      that continued to emphasize the hierarchy of the information presented.</p>
    <figure class="figure">
      <img src="./assets/bento-box-wireframe2.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Bento Box V.2</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="deliver" id="deliver">
    <h3>Deliver</h3>
    <p>Finally feeling confident in our layout decisions, applying the UI design elements felt much smoother. While
      continuing our efforts to keep elements of the original website familiar to returning users, we knew that changes
      would have to be made to the original color scheme of the website. The original background and text color did not
      pass accessibility with only a 2.6 rating. So, we darkened up the background and used the old background color as
      an accent color to keep the color present on the website, plus added a few other pops of color to help draw
      attention when needed.</p>
    <div class="style-figs">
      <figure class="figure">
        <img src="./assets/style-tile.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">UI Style Tile</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure class="figure">
        <img src="./assets/home-page-new.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Bento Box with Applied Style</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>The bento box layout allows for a lot of information to be added, but also keeps it visually contained to help
      readers assess what information is needed. In the future, we’d want to add additional elements to the website to
      further help users navigate and use the website. We want to expand on the payment system and have it more embedded
      into the website to make sure users don’t have to leave the website to complete their purchase. </p>
